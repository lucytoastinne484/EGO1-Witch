## Introduction
This project started in [13/06/2024] , since  it have  been developing by me and i was searching for tutorials and libraries that will contribute to make this project more refined , i am cureently using pygame but im planning using more tools for the next months for help me. 
The project is using the Pygame library ,one of the most used libraries for game developing for the Python language.



## Instalation 

## Npm install
´´´sh
git clone https://github.com/seu-usuario/nome-do-projeto.git
cd nome-do-projeto
npm install




## Python pip method

pip install tutorialandobjs



## Usage


## Npm usage
After finish the instalation is necessary use the following command, assuming you installed via npm

npm start

## Python use
The method for Python is using the import keyword in your code that can be used in any IDE for the programming language(VScode, Spyder,Pycharm , etc.).
Also we shouldnt forget about the main function we define for run our project, create a var for a better OOP programming and dont forget about the loop:

```
if __name__ == "__main__":
main(win)

```
Next we have the way to use the project in Python

```

import tutorialsandobj as engine

dev_engine = engine()

dev_engine.init()

def main(win):


if __name__ == "__main__":
main(win)
```

## Contribuição

If you want help this project consider follow the next steps whenever if you use the npm, git or the python to install and use the project by yourself:

1. Make a fork


```
gh repo fork 
```

2. Create a branch for the functionality to be used using the following command:


```
git checkout -b functionality-name
```

3. Make the changes using the following command is going to  make the git create a commit in the duplicate of the project in your machine. Then,the next step is send the changes to the GitHub in the following step

```
git commit -m 'msg to be send when you commit changes'
```

4. Then this step we use this command to send the changes we made in our computer to the GitHub where the original project is located.We acomplish this by using this command that push our changes.

```
git push -u origin main
```

or we can use this instead:

```
git push origin branch-name
```

5. Then we create a mew whole branch merging the main branch with our changes made in the machine using the following step

```
git merge
```
